sfAssetsLibrary plugin
======================

The `sfAssetsLibraryPlugin` is a full-featured multimedia asset library plugin.
Not only does it allow you to upload and organize your media files
(images, PDF documents, Flash objects, and so on) via a web interface, it also
stores metadata about each file for easy retrieval or automated copyright and
legend inclusion. It is the perfect companion for rich text editors like TinyMCE.

Prerequisites
-------------

This plugin for symfony 1.4 depends on [sfThumbnailPlugin](/plugins/sfThumbnailPlugin)
to create thumbnails of image files. If this plugin is not yest installed, the symfony
plugin dependency system will install it when you install sfAssetsLibraryPlugin.

Note: If [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) is installed (no need for the PEAR
Imagick package, the plugin calls the `convert` script of the basic Image Magic
library), then the image thumbnails will be of better quality. See the "Configuration"
section below for the way to activate ImageMagick support in the plugin.

Installation
------------

1 - Install the plugin.

The easiest way to install `sfAssetsLibraryPlugin` is to use the symfony command line:

    > php symfony plugin:install sfAssetsLibraryPlugin

Alternatively, if you don't have PEAR installed, you can download the latest package
attached to this plugin's wiki page and extract it under your project's `plugins/`
directory. You can also refer to the plugin's Subversion repository by doing a
checkout or an `svn:externals` of http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfAssetsLibraryPlugin.

If you use one of these alternative methods, you must publish the plugin assets by
calling the `plugin:publish-assets` symfony task.

2 - Build the data structures

Rebuild the model and generate the SQL code for the new tables:

    > php symfony propel:build-model
    > php symfony propel:build-forms
    > php symfony propel:build-filters
    > php symfony propel:build-sql

Create the new tables in your database.

    > php symfony propel:insert-sql

3 - Configure your project to use the plugin features

Enable the `sfAssetsLibraryPlugin` and the `sfThumbnailPlugin` in the project
configuration

    [php]
    // in myproject/config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php
    class ProjectConfiguration extends sfProjectConfiguration
    {
      public function setup()
      {
        $this->enablePlugins(array('sfPropelPlugin', 'sfAssetsLibraryPlugin', 'sfThumbnailPlugin'));
      }
    }

Enable the `sfAsset` module in your backend application, via the
`settings.yml` file.

    [yml]
    // in myproject/apps/backend/config/settings.yml
    all:
      .settings:
        enabled_modules:        [default, sfAsset]

Configure the path to the root assets directory in the `app.yml` file:

    [yml]
    // in myproject/config/app.yml
    all:
      sfAssetsLibrary:
        upload_dir:               media

In the above example, uploaded files will be stored under the `web/media`
directory.

4 - Clear the cache to enable the autoloading to find the new classes:

    > php symfony cc

5 - Use the bundled `asset:create-root` task to initialize the root asset
directory in the filesystem and in the database. The name of the root asset
directory will be read from the `app.yml` configuration you just defined:

    > php symfony asset:create-root

Note: *nix users must call this command with the same user group as the http
server, because it will need write access to this directory.

6 - You can now start using the plugin by browsing to the backend module's
default page:

    http://myproject/backend_dev.php/sfAsset

Configuration
-------------

You can modify the plugin settings by way of the configuration. Here is a list
of the settings you can change in your application's `app.yml`:

    [yml]
    # in apps/backend/config/app.yml
    all:
      sfAssetsLibrary:
        upload_dir:       media              # Asset library root, under the web/ dir
        check_type:       false              # Set to true if you want to restrict the type of assets
        types:                               # Accepted asset types if check_type is true
          image:   image
          txt:     txt
          archive: archive
          pdf:     pdf
          xls:     xls
          doc:     doc
          ppt:     ppt
        thumbnail_dir:    thumbnail          # Where the image thumbnails are stored
        use_ImageMagick:  false              # Set to true if you have the convert command
        thumbnails:                          # Name and size (in pixels) of the thumbnails created at upload
          small:                             # Displayed in the list page
            width: 84
            height: 84
            shave: true                      # Cut strips to constraint the image size
          large:                             # Displayed in the details page
            width: 194
            height: 152
        search_pager_size: 20                # Number of resuts per page
        mass_upload_size:  5                 # Number of file upload controls displayed in the mass upload form


The `sfAsset` module
--------------------

The `sfAsset` module provides four main features:
 - Browse through your media files like in a filesystem.
 - Read or change metadata for a particular file
 - Perform usual filesystem operztions on your files and folder (add, move, rename, delete)
 - Search for a particular media file from its filename, description, author, etc.

The module has two main views (`list` and `edit`) that you can easily customize by
using your own CSS or overriding some of their numerous partials in your application.
The templates are organized the same way as the admin generated modules, so applying
your own look and feel to the sfAssetsLibrary should be easy.

The module is fully i18n'ed, and the plugin comes with English, French, Italian,
and German translations.

Using the assets from the library in your applications
------------------------------------------------------

Uploaded assets end up under the `sfConfig::get('sf_web_root') . sfConfig::get('app_sfAssetsLibrary_upload_dir')`
directory. The path to a particular media file appears in its details page fo the
`sfAsset` module, so if you need to use it somewhere in your application, just
copy this path. Alternatively, if you need to include an image tag to an asset
you retrieved from the database, you can use the `asset_image_tag()` helper:

    [php]
    <?php use_helper('sfAsset') ?>
    <?php echo asset_image_tag($sf_asset) ?>


Importing assets from an existing library
-----------------------------------------

Whether you want to add assets to your library from an existing sfMediaLibrary,
r to cleanup your database of removed files, you will probably need to synchronize
the assets database with a directory.

Fortunately, the plugin comes with a pake task to do just that: `asset:synchronize`:

    > php symfony asset:synchronize [app] [dirname] --notVerbose --removeOrphanAssets --removeOrphanFolders

For instance, to import an existing Media Library under web/uploads/media to
the sfAssetsLibrary, just type:

    > php symfony asset:synchronize backend /path/to/project/web/uploads/media --removeOrphanAssets --removeOrphanFolders

You can call this task as many times you want, since it only performs database and
filesystem operations when the two sources are not in sync.

Using the assets library with TinyMCE
-------------------------------------

If you want to use the sfAssetsLibrary plugin as a replacement for tinyMCE's file
browser for image insertion, you must first initiate the plugin with a helper in
the template:

    [php]
    <?php use_helper('sfAsset') ?>
    <?php use_javascript('tiny_mce/tiny_mce') /* must point to your actual path of tinyMCE */ ?>
    <?php echo init_asset_library() ?>

The next thing to do is to pass a special JavaScript callback function to the
TinyMCE object at initialization. This should be done in you tinyMCE's configuration file:

    [javascript]
    tinyMCE.init({
      theme : "advanced",
      mode: "textareas",
      editor_selector : "rich",
      file_browser_callback : 'sfAssetsLibrary.fileBrowserCallBack'
    });

If you use the configuration above, you can add tinyMCE to all your textarea's with class
"rich" (with generator.yml in admin generator, or with form templates otherwise).

That's it, the TinyMCE file browser is now the sfAssetsLibrary's one.

>**TIP**: For use with an admin generated module, place the `init_asset_library()` call
>in the `_assets.php` partial in the `templates/` directory of the module. If you miss
>that template, just copy it from the cache auto-generated module.
>To add class in a `generator.yml`, do as follows:

    [yml]
    generator:
      class:              sfPropelGenerator
      param:
        model_class:      Post
        theme:            admin

        config:
          fields:
            content: { class: rich }


Using the form's widget
-----------------------

Traditionally, when an asset has to be referenced in a form, a file input is used
(`<input type='file'>`). It allows the user to upload a file from his computer to
the server, and this file can be further embedded in a rich text content.

Using the `sfAssetsLibraryPlugin`, you can change this control into some sort of
file input that refers to the assets library, or, to put it differently, to the
files located on the server in `web/media`. The plugin comes with a special widget
for that purpose, the `sfWidgetFormAssetInput`. Use is just like a regular widget:

    [php]
    public function configure()
    {
      $this->widgetSchema['asset_id'] = new sfWidgetFormAssetInput();
      // usually you don't need to define validator, it should be already defined in generated form
      $this->validatorSchema['asset_id'] = new sfValidatorPropelChoice('model' => 'sfAsset');
    }

If not in admin generator, remember to use `use_javascripts_for_form($form)` in your form's template.

This input is not a real file input tag, meaning that the chosen asset file will not
be posted with the request. Instead, the action will be able to retrieve the asset
file path relative to the web root, exactly what is needed to display it. Incidentally,
this means that your form doesn't need to be set multipart.

Optionally, you can restrict the choice of possible assets in this input to images
only, as follows:

    [php]
    <?php echo input_sf_asset_tag('my_asset_field', '', array('images_only' => true)) ?>
